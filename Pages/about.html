    <h2 style="text-align:center;">Vision</h2>
    <div>
        <p>Our vision for this application is to further add value to any individual tracking their finances. <br>Our development roadmap includes features such as: </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Scanning and uploading documents to autofill information. This would include being able to upload paystubs, checks, bank statements, and etc instead of having to manually add financial info. </li>
            <li>Email notifications to summarize a user's finances monthly. This would also involve reminders to add certain financial information if necessary. </li>
            <li>Community Forum. This would add the ability to discuss finances, and perhaps learn from others. We recommend each individual to make their own informed financial decisions. </li>
            <li>Connect application to bank. This would allow for automated information input. </li>
        </ol>
