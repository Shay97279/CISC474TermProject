    <br>
    <div>
        <p>Simply put, investing can help you get ahead in life. It can be key to helping you grow your worth over time and provide the kind of future for yourself and your family that you dream about. It has the potential to let you literally earn money in your sleep. So there's no doubt that it's worth your time to figure out how it all works.</p>

    <h2 style="text-align:center;">Assets</h2>
    <br>
    <div>
        <p>Assets are owned value. This can include everything from real estate, stocks, bonds, land, jewelry, and more. The traditional assets are considered to be stocks and bonds.  </p>
        <br>
        <div>
            <h3 style="text-align:center;">Stocks</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Stocks give shareholders a share of ownership in a company. Investors purchase stocks hoping they will go up in price, to earn dividend payments (if the company distributes some of its earnings to stockholders), and to vote shares and influence company decisions. Stocks can be categorized in many ways, including as growth stocks (where investors hope the company and stock price grow rapidly), income stocks (where investors seek consistent income), and value stocks (where investors seek stable returns). They can also be classified by size: Large caps (the largest-size companies), mid caps (relatively medium-sized companies), and small caps (the smallest companies). Stocks are generally considered to have more risk and return potential compared with bonds.</p>

        <div>
            <h3 style="text-align:center;">Bonds</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Bonds are debt investmentsâ€”similar to an IOU. Borrowers sell bonds to raise money for a certain amount of time. When you buy a bond, you are entitled to receive a specified rate of interest during the life of the bond and to receive back your original investment (also known as the principal or face value) when the bond comes due after a set period of time. Types of bonds include government, municipal, and corporate. They can be categorized different ways, including investment grade (i.e., those that have a higher credit rating, implying they are relatively less risky) and high yield (i.e., those that have a lower credit rating, implying they are relatively more risky).</p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Stocks and bonds are the most common components in mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which are baskets of investments combined into a single investment option. Mutual funds and ETFs pool money from many investors and invest all that money collectively. Investors can buy shares in a mutual fund or ETF, with each share representing part ownership in the fund. Among the differences between these 2 investment choices: ETF share prices fluctuate during the day on a stock exchange, while mutual funds are valued at the end of the trading day. Because they are baskets of investments, mutual funds and exchange-traded funds may help you more easily build a diversified portfolio.</p>
