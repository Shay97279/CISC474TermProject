    <h2 style="text-align:center;">Expenses</h2>
    <br>
    <div>
        <p>Expenses can be considered any form of spending. It involves the outflow of cash and typically where the bulk of income goes. Spending is whatever an individual uses their income to buy. This includes rent, mortgage, groceries, hobbies, eating out, home furnishings, home repairs, travel, and entertainment.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Being able to manage spending is a critical aspect of personal finance. Individuals must ensure their spending is less than their income; otherwise, they won't have enough money to cover their expenses or will fall into debt. Debt can be devastating financially, particularly with the high-interest rates credit cards charge.</p>
        <br>

    </div>


    <h2 style="text-align:center;">Income</h2>
    <br>
    <div>
        <p>Income is the starting point of personal finance. It is the entire amount of cash inflow that you receive and can allocate to expenses, savings, investments, and protection. Income is all the money you bring in. This includes salaries, wages, dividends, and other sources of cash inflow. </p>

    <h2 style="text-align:center;">Investing</h2>
    <br>
    <div>
        <p>Investing can help you get ahead in life. It can be key to helping you grow your worth over time and provide the kind of future for yourself and your family that you dream about. It has the potential to let you literally earn money in your sleep. So there's no doubt that it's worth your time to figure out how it all works.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In the most straightforward sense, investing works when you buy an asset at a low price and sell it at a higher price. This kind of return on your investment called a capital gain. Earning returns by selling assets for a profit—or realizing your capital gains—is one way to make money investing. For now we'll stick to stocks and bonds. </p>

    <h2 style="text-align:center;">Assets</h2>
    <br>
    <div>
        <p>Assets are owned value. This can include everything from real estate, stocks, bonds, land, jewelry, and more. The traditional assets are considered to be stocks and bonds.  </p>
        <br>
        <div>
            <h3 style="text-align:center;">Stocks</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Stocks give shareholders a share of ownership in a company. Investors purchase stocks hoping they will go up in price, to earn dividend payments (if the company distributes some of its earnings to stockholders), and to vote shares and influence company decisions. Stocks can be categorized in many ways, including as growth stocks (where investors hope the company and stock price grow rapidly), income stocks (where investors seek consistent income), and value stocks (where investors seek stable returns). They can also be classified by size: Large caps (the largest-size companies), mid caps (relatively medium-sized companies), and small caps (the smallest companies). Stocks are generally considered to have more risk and return potential compared with bonds.</p>
        </div>


        <div>
            <h3 style="text-align:center;">Bonds</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Bonds are debt investments—similar to an IOU. Borrowers sell bonds to raise money for a certain amount of time. When you buy a bond, you are entitled to receive a specified rate of interest during the life of the bond and to receive back your original investment (also known as the principal or face value) when the bond comes due after a set period of time. Types of bonds include government, municipal, and corporate. They can be categorized different ways, including investment grade (i.e., those that have a higher credit rating, implying they are relatively less risky) and high yield (i.e., those that have a lower credit rating, implying they are relatively more risky).</p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Stocks and bonds are the most common components in mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which are baskets of investments combined into a single investment option. Mutual funds and ETFs pool money from many investors and invest all that money collectively. Investors can buy shares in a mutual fund or ETF, with each share representing part ownership in the fund. Among the differences between these 2 investment choices: ETF share prices fluctuate during the day on a stock exchange, while mutual funds are valued at the end of the trading day. Because they are baskets of investments, mutual funds and exchange-traded funds may help you more easily build a diversified portfolio.</p>

    <h2 style="text-align:center;">Saving & Budgeting</h2>
    <br>
    <div>
        <p>Budgeting is the act of putting together a budget, which is an estimate of your revenue and expected expenses for a given time period. Savings refers to the money left over after your expenses are subtracted from your revenue, also within a specific time period. By creating a budget, you may be able to locate and cut any unnecessary expenditures, thereby increasing your savings.</p>
        <br>
        <p>By keeping tabs on your expenses and giving yourself a plan to follow, budgeting makes it easier to meet your financial goals. Savings, meanwhile, are important because living paycheck to paycheck isn’t viable in the long-term. If you are unable to accumulate savings, you could be in serious financial trouble in the event of an unexpected expense, such as a large medical bill.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The first step to budgeting is determining your net income (i.e., your total salary minus taxes and employer-provided programs) for a given time period. The next step is to figure out your fixed and variable expenses for the same period of time. You can then either decide how to utilize any surplus funds or find ways to reduce your expenses if they exceed your income. There are several budgeting plans available that can help you allocate an appropriate amount of money to each type of expense.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The 50/30/20 rule is a budgeting technique. The idea is that people will be able to more easily achieve greater financial stability by dividing specific shares of their spending between distinct categories. The three categories of the 50/30/20 rule are: 50% allocated to needs (i.e., rent, healthcare, etc.), 30% to wants (i.e., travel, entertainment, etc.), and 20% toward savings.</p>

    <h2 style="text-align:center;">Financial Risk</h2>
    <br>
    <div>
        <p>Financial risk is the possibility of losing money on an investment or business venture. Some more common and distinct financial risks include credit risk, liquidity risk, and operational risk.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Financial risk is a type of danger that can result in the loss of capital to interested parties. For governments, this can mean they are unable to control monetary policy and default on bonds or other debt issues. Corporations also face the possibility of default on debt they undertake but may also experience failure in an undertaking the causes a financial burden on the business.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Individuals can face financial risk when they make poor decisions. This hazard can have wide-ranging causes from taking an unnecessary day off of work to investing in highly speculative investments. Every undertaking has exposure to pure risk—dangers that cannot be controlled, but some are done without fully realizing the consequences.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Liquidity risk comes in two flavors for investors to fear. The first involves securities and assets that cannot be purchased or sold quickly enough to cut losses in a volatile market. Known as market liquidity risk this is a situation where there are few buyers but many sellers. The second risk is funding or cash flow liquidity risk. Funding liquidity risk is the possibility that a corporation will not have the capital to pay its debt, forcing it to default, and harming stakeholders.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Speculative risk is one where a profit or gain has an uncertain chance of success. Perhaps the investor did not conduct proper research before investing, reached too far for gains, or invested too large of a portion of their net worth into a single investment.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Pros</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Encourages more informed decisions</li>
            <li>Helps assess value (risk-reward ratio)</li>
            <li>Can be identified using analysis tools</li>
        </ul>  
        
        <br>
        <p>Cons</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Can arise from uncontrollable or unpredictable outside forces</li>
            <li>Risks can be difficult to overcome </li>
            <li>Ability to spread and affect entire sectors or markets</li>
        </ul>

    <h2 style="text-align:center;">Asset Growth (Compounding)</h2>
    <br>
    <div>
        <p> Compounding is a powerful investing concept that involves earning returns on both your original investment and on returns you received previously. For compounding to work, you need to reinvest your returns back into your account. For example, you invest $1,000 and earn a 6% rate of return. In the first year, you would make $60, bringing your total investment to $1,060, if you reinvest your return. </p>
        <br>
        <p>Next year, you would earn a return on your total $1,060 investment. If your return were once again 6%, you’d make $63.60, bringing your total investment to $1,123.60.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Take the effort out of compounding by reinvesting your earnings automatically. In turn, those earnings add to the value of your account and boost the potential to earn even more. The key? Patience. Don't be tempted to withdraw the funds when they grow. Keep in mind that if you hold your investments in a taxable account, you'll still be taxed on the interest, dividends, and capital gains you receive, even if you reinvest them into the account.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Want to help build your money faster? Add new money to the account regularly.</p>
